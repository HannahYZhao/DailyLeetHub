Combinatorial Mathematics
Intuition
The number of unique paths can be seen as the number of ways to choose mâˆ’1 downs and nâˆ’1 rights, regardless of the order. In combinatorial terms, this is equivalent to(m + n - 2 to m - 1)
Algorithm
1. Use the combinatorial formula:
   (m + n - 2 to m - 1) or (m + n - 2 to n - 1) to calculate the number of unique paths.
2. Python's Math Library:
   Python provides a built-in function math.comb(n, k) to talculate(n to k) efficiently. 
'''
import math

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return math.comb(n + m - 2, n - 1)
